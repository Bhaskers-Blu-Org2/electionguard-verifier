#+TITLE: ElectionGuard Verifier

* TODO

- [X] Check proofs of public key posession
- [ ] Check proofs of selection being 0/1
- [ ] Check proofs of correct numbers of selections
- [ ] Check proofs of decryption for spoiled ballots (fragments and shares)
- [ ] Check proofs of decryption for tallies (fragments and shares) 
- [ ] Add optimized method for checking CP proofs where the message is
  the quotient of two messages; we can avoid a division
- [ ] Generalize hash interface to not use BigUint. Maybe use bytes,
  or be more general to handle whole messages and automatically
  convert to bytes.
- [ ] Investigate if we want to reuse input struct for error shape by
  paremetrizing over annotations
- [ ] Think about never ever using vecs of vecs, but always making an
  intermediate struct. It feels like everything is easier that way
- [ ] Use the num type to avoid explicit mod
- [ ] Add option to link against [[https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-gmpmee][GIMP Verificatum]]
- [ ] Generate types more automatically from [[https://quicktype.io][quicktype]], see also [fn:1]
- [ ] Look into lazy trees or something (nested iterators?) to avoid
  unnecessary allocation for errors/statuses when all we want to do is
  print them out one by one
